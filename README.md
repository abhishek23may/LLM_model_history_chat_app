The HistoryChat App is a Gemini based application for learning Indian history using natural language processing. It reads PDFs, splits text, generates embeddings, and employs a conversational question-answering model. 
The app's potential lies in combining NLP techniques to provide an interactive educational platform for users interested in Indian history.
